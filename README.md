## Solcast Configuration

[Solcast service](https://solcast.com/) requires a personal registration with an email address.
A free version for your personal home PV system is available in [Hobbyist Plan](https://toolkit.solcast.com.au/register/hobbyist)
You need to configure your home photovoltaic system within the web interface.
After configuration the necessary information is available.

In order to receive proper timestamps double check your time zone in *openHAB - Settings - Regional Settings*.
Correct time zone is necessary to show correct forecast times in UI. 

### Solcast Tuning

You've the opportunity to [send your own measurements back to Solcast API](https://legacy-docs.solcast.com.au/#measurements-rooftop-site).
This data is used internally to improve the forecast for your specific site.
Configuration and channels can be set after checking the *Show advanced* checkbox.
You need an item which reports the electric power for the specific rooftop. 
If this item isn't set no measures will be sent.
As described in [Solcast Rooftop Measurement](https://legacy-docs.solcast.com.au/#measurements-rooftop-site) check in beforehand if your measures are *sane*.

- item is delivering good values and they are stored in persistence
- time settings in openHAB are correct in order to so measurements are matching to the measure time frame

After the measurement is sent the `raw-tuning` channel is reporting the result.

### Solcast Bridge Configuration

| apiKey                 | text    | API Key                               | N/A     | yes      |
| channelRefreshInterval | integer | Channel Refresh Interval in minutes   | 1       | yes      |

`apiKey` can be obtained in your [Account Settings](https://toolkit.solcast.com.au/account)


### Solcast Plane Configuration

| Name            | Type    | Description                                            | Default         | Required | Advanced |
|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| resourceId      | text    | Resource Id of Solcast rooftop site                    | N/A             | yes      | no       |
| refreshInterval | integer | Forecast Refresh Interval in minutes                   | 120             | yes      | no       |
| powerItem       | text    | Power item from your solar inverter for this rooftop   | N/A             | no       | yes      |
| powerUnit       | text    | Unit selection of the powerItem                        | auto-detect     | no       | yes      |

`resourceId` for each plane can be obtained in your [Rooftop Sites](https://toolkit.solcast.com.au/rooftop-sites)

`refreshInterval` of forecast data needs to respect the throttling of the Solcast service. 
If you've 25 free calls per day, each plane needs 2 calls per update a refresh interval of 120 minutes will result in 24 calls per day.

Note: `channelRefreshInterval` from [Bridge Configuration](#solcast-bridge-configuration) will calculate intermediate values without requesting new forecast data.

`powerItem` shall reflect the power for this specific rooftop. 
It's an optional setting and the [measure is sent to Solcast API in order to tune the forecast](https://legacy-docs.solcast.com.au/#measurements-rooftop-site) in the future.
If you don't want to sent measures to Solcast leave this configuration item empty.

`powerUnit` is set to `auto-detect`. 
In case the `powerItem` is delivering a valid `QuantityType<Power>` state this setting is fine.
If the item delivers a raw number without unit please select `powerUnit` accordingly if item state is Watt or Kilowatt unit. 

## Solcast Channels

Each `sc-plane` reports it's own values including a `raw` channel holding json content.
The `sc-site` bridge sums up all attached `sc-plane` values and provides the total forecast for your home location.  

Channels are covering today's actual data with current, remaining and today's total prediction.
Forecasts are delivered up to 6 days in advance including 

- a pessimistic scenario: 10th percentile 
- an optimistic scenario: 90th percentile

Day*X* channels are referring to forecasts plus *X* days: 1 = tomorrow, 2 = day after tomorrow, ...

`refreshInterval` of forecast data needs to respect the throttling of the ForecastSolar service. 
12 calls per hour allowed from your caller IP address so for 2 planes lowest possible refresh rate is 10 minutes.

Note: `channelRefreshInterval` from [Bridge Configuration](#forecastsolar-bridge-configuration) will calculate intermediate values without requesting new forecast data.

## ForecastSolar Channels

Each `fs-plane` reports it's own values including a `raw` channel holding json content.
The `fs-site` bridge sums up all attached `fs-plane` values and provides the total forecast for your home location.  

Channels are covering todays actual data with current, remaining and today's total prediction.
Forecasts are delivered up to 3 days for paid personal plans.

Day*X* channels are referring to forecasts plus *X* days: 1 = tomorrow, 2 = day after tomorrow, ...

## Thing Actions

All things `sc-site`, `sc-plane`, `fs-site` and `fs-plane` are providing the same Actions.
While channels are providing actual forecast data and daily forecasts in future Actions provides an interface to execute more sophisticated handling in rules.
You can execute this for each `xx-plane` for specific plane values or `xx-site` to sum up all attached planes.

Input for queries are `LocalDateTime` and `LocalDate` objects. 
Double check your time zone in *openHAB - Settings - Regional Settings* which is crucial for calculation.
